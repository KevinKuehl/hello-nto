# Example Kubernetes Ingress

This is a reasonably interesting example of a Kubernetes ingress implemented on
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).

Three URLs pathes are supported in the configuration:
* **/** maps to a Google provided container image with the tag
  gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
* **/hello** maps to the container image built from the
  [hello_nto.go](../hello_nto.go) file in the root of this repo
* **/debug** maps to the container image built from the
  [ingress_nto.go](ingress_nto.go) file in this directory
